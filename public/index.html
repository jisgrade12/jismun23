      <h4>
        We are delighted and honored to welcome you to the first JIS Model UN
        on-campus. We are incredibly grateful for the chance to be here with our
        amazing team as we work to lay the groundwork for this MUN and hopefully
        many others to come.
        <br />
        <br />
        My dear colleagues, students, and delegates. We are all rapidly
        approaching the crisis point of the culmination of many catastrophes at
        once, as the entire world is rapidly becoming more and more aware and as
        scientists and historians have been warning for decades.
        <br />
        <br />
        Every single one of our homes is confronted with the global challenge of
        a conflict that is unprecedentedâ€”more horrifying, intricate, and
        interconnected than ever before. All the unresolved conflicts from
        earlier generations are now our responsibility, and we need to prevent
        them from passing to the next generation before it's too late for them,
        too. We are not the first people to go through hardship, lose ourselves
        in a catastrophe, or fear that the future will never come.
        <br />
        <br />
        We must do everything in our power to be the last, though, out of
        respect for every soul that hasn't yet had the chance to live. That is
        why the UN was established, and that is why we are assembling at this
        conference right now to try to find a solution. to dig up the rotten
        roots that society has tried to bury, forgetting that rot always finds a
        way to spread and that the only way to treat it is to get rid of the
        infection.
        <br />
        <br />
        To that end, I sincerely hope that each of you will give this event your
        all and leave not only convinced that this world can indeed change for
        the better in order to heal and break free from its chains, but also
        determined to see it through.
        <br />
        <br />
        Regards, <br />
        JIS MUN 2023 Team
