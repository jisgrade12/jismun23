        <h4>
          We are delighted and honored to welcome you to the first JIS Model UN
          on-campus. We are incredibly grateful for the chance to be here with
          our amazing team as we work to lay the groundwork for this MUN and
          hopefully many others to come.
          <br />
          <br />
          My dear colleagues, students, and delegates. We are all rapidly
          approaching the crisis point of the culmination of many catastrophes
          at once, as the entire world is rapidly becoming more and more aware
          and as scientists and historians have been warning for decades.
          <br />
          <br />
          Every single one of our homes is confronted with the global challenge
          of a conflict that is unprecedentedâ€”more horrifying, intricate, and
          interconnected than ever before. All the unresolved conflicts from
          earlier generations are now our responsibility, and we need to prevent
          them from passing to the next generation before it's too late for
          them, too. We are not the first people to go through hardship, lose
          ourselves in a catastrophe, or fear that the future will never come.
          <br />
          <br />
          We must do everything in our power to be the last, though, out of
          respect for every soul that hasn't yet had the chance to live. That is
          why the UN was established, and that is why we are assembling at this
          conference right now to try to find a solution. to dig up the rotten
          roots that society has tried to bury, forgetting that rot always finds
          a way to spread and that the only way to treat it is to get rid of the
          infection.
          <br />
          <br />
          To that end, I sincerely hope that each of you will give this event
          your all and leave not only convinced that this world can indeed
          change for the better in order to heal and break free from its chains,
          but also determined to see it through.
          <br />
          <br />
          Regards, <br />
          JIS MUN 2023 Team
